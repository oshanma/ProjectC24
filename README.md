## Summary

SumFinder27 is a C++ program designed to read 1000 integers from a text file and determine if any combination of those integers sums to 27. 
If a valid combination is found, the program outputs "YES" followed by the integers that sum to 27; otherwise, it outputs "NO â€“ No combination sums to 27." 
Additionally, the program measures and displays the time taken for this operation in milliseconds. 
The program is built with performance in mind, ensuring quick and efficient processing even with large datasets.

## Application Features

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [x] The program reads 1000 integers from an input file.
- [x] It checks all possible combinations of three integers to see if they sum to 27.
- [x] The program outputs the result to a `.out` file, including the set of integers that sum to 27 or a message indicating no such combination exists.
- [x] The elapsed time for the operation is calculated and displayed in milliseconds.

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [x] The program is optimized to handle larger datasets efficiently.
- [x] Custom output formatting is applied to make the results easily readable.
- [x] The program's logic is structured to minimize unnecessary calculations, reducing the overall processing time.
